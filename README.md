# The Project Aim
The project aims to provide you with a unique experience in utilizing and
improving your datascience skills on a real-world task of stroke prediction and reporting
your results in a paper-stylereport.

# The Project: Stroke Prediction
The blockage or burst of a blood vessel in the brain is called a stroke, sometimes called a brainattack. As a result
of a stroke, parts of the brain become damaged or die, which may cause long-term brain damage, disability, or death.
Stroke is the second leading cause ofdeath in the world, and metabolic risks (like high blood pressure, high body-mass
index (BMI), orhigh cholesterol) and behavioral factors (such as smoking, poor diet, and low physical activity)
mayincrease one’s chances of having a stroke.

# The Task
Given some clinical features, the task is to predict stroke events.

# The Datasets
The DatasetsThis project uses two publicly available datasets from the Kaggle.

1.Real-world data: The Stroke Prediction Dataset •https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

2.Synthetic data: The Synthetic Stroke Prediction Dataset •https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e2/data

This dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Stroke Prediction Dataset.
